🦸 **Superhero Name Generator**

A mini Machine Learning project that generates unique superhero names using character-level text generation. Built to learn core NLP concepts such as tokenization, sequence padding, and sequential character prediction using TensorFlow/Keras.

**Key Learnings**

1.Text preprocessing with Keras Tokenizer

2.Character-level sequence modeling

3.Padding and label generation

4.Neural network–based text generation

**Tech Stack**

Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy

**Purpose**

Created as a hands-on project while working toward mastering Machine Learning, a field I’m deeply passionate about.
